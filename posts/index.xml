      <description>recipE-Z: the recipe finder app January - May 2020
What is recipE-Z? As a way to help alleviate food waste, we built an iOS app that will present you with recipes based on the ingredients you already have. A user can enter a list of ingredients or a specific recipe and then our app will search through a database of recipes, from online or submitted by users in our app. It will present results ranging from recipes that can be made with everything the user already has to recipes that will require extra ingredients.</description>

      <description>divvi: the bill splitting app February 2020
In February, I participated in my second hack-a-thon, CuseHacks, and our team won Best Use of Google API!
What is divvi? We built a receipt scanner app called &amp;lsquo;divvi&amp;rsquo; that focused on facilitating a productive conversation between you and your fellow meal splitters by itemizing your receipt and calculating the totals owed by each. We prioritized the user experience and wanted to promote chatter at the table rather than detract from it.</description>

      <description>Plant Simulator Built in C++ OpenGL April - May 2020
For my final project in my Social Media and Data Mining class, I wanted to evaluate the toxcity of YouTube communities by performing sentiment analysis on YouTube comments.
What was our data mining process? Storing the Data: MongoDB Because our team was working remotely and needed to share the data for analysis and examination of results, we decided to use a cloud-based database.</description>
